<p>There is no time limit for finishing the Sudoku puzzle. However, if you achieve a very good score time you can upload your score to the leaderboard. If you get a better time score later on and typing in same username as before, your score will be updated to the better one. To prevent cheating, if you load a saved game then you will not be able to upload the score to the leaderboard.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">2. Rules</h2>
<p>The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares. The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box. The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission. Every puzzle has just one correct solution.</p>
